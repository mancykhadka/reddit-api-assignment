A little backstory.
It all started a few years ago when I went to the bowling alley with a group of friends and I was unable to curl the 8lb ball. Pretty big eye opener that made me want to hit the gym. I thought at first it would be nearly impossible, but my buddies gave me a hand and were my gym partners from that day on. My goal weight is 155 pounds and hopefully someday I'll reach that goal. Regardless I am pretty content with this transformation.
